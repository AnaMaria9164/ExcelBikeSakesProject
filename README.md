# Excel Data Transformation and Visualization Project

## Overview

This project demonstrates data transformation and visualization techniques using Microsoft Excel. It involves transforming raw data into a structured format, creating pivot tables for analysis, and designing a dashboard with slicers for interactive exploration.

## Raw Data

The initial dataset contains information about individuals, including their marital status, gender, income, education, etc.

## Transformations

The raw data underwent various transformations, including formatting adjustments, categorization of age brackets, and column renaming for clarity.

## Pivot Tables

Three pivot tables were created to analyze the data:

1. **Marital Status Analysis**: Analyzing purchasing behavior based on marital status.
2. **Education and Occupation Analysis**: Examining the distribution of education levels and occupations.
3. **Region and Purchased Bike Analysis**: Understanding bike purchase trends across different regions.

## Dashboard

A dashboard was designed to provide a visual summary of the data, featuring interactive slicers for filtering and dynamic visualization of bike purchase behavior.

## Files Overview

- `bike_buyers.xlsx`: Initial raw data file.
- `Working Sheet.xlsx`: Transformed data with adjustments and categorizations.
- `Pivot Table.xlsx`: Excel file containing pivot tables for analysis.
- `Dashboard.xlsx`: Excel file housing the interactive dashboard with slicers.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open `Working Sheet.xlsx` to view the cleaned and transformed dataset.
3. Explore `Pivot_Table.xlsx` to delve into the detailed analysis provided by pivot tables.
4. Access `Dashboard.xlsx` to interact with the dashboard and slicers for dynamic visualization.
